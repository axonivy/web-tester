# Web Tester

This connector is all about keeping your workflow app functionalâ€”without the need for constant manual verification. Instead of testing by manually clicking through every user dialog after each small change, automated web integration tests ensure that the core flow (happy path) remains intact. These tests are not only highly automatable due to their repetitive nature but also enable CI/CD initiatives with minimal effort.

This tool supports you with a step-by-step [documentation](https://developer.axonivy.com/doc/12.0/concepts/testing/web-testing.html).
