# Web Tester

Imagine you've developed a workflow app with multiple user dialogs. Do you really want to manually click through the entire process every time you make a small change? A much more efficient approach is to use automated web integration tests: they reliably validate the functional flow (happy path) and are highly automatable thanks to their repetitive nature.

This tool supports you with a step-by-step [documentation](https://developer.axonivy.com/doc/12.0/concepts/testing/web-testing.html).
